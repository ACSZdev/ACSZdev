- 👋 Hi, I’m @ACSZdev, originally just ACSZ, but since that's taken somewhere I added "dev" to the end because this is more of a development community.
- 👀 I’m interested in Developing / Coding, with languages such as Javascript, React, Binary, CSS, CS++, and more.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Blender, but I am still working on plenty of other projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! Just ask me.
- 📫 How to reach me I am acs_z on Discord, 1a1 (@Crx_tivx) on Roblox, acs_z on Lunar and Minecraft, and ACSZ on Xbox PC.
- 😄 Pronouns: He / Him, any really, not one to complain nor care about pronouns as long as it's reasonable and you aren't misgendering me.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have over 3 projects as of now.
